# ReactWebPage

Create a web applica-on using create-react-app:

1. Create a User card grid layout having navbar showing any brand name
2. Add a bu;on in the navbar saying 'Get Users', which makes an API call to get the user data
3. Use reqres.in/api/users?page=1 to get the data
4. Show a loader while the API fetches the data.
5. Bonus points for using custom CSS/SASS/styled-components.
6. Bonus points for clean code.

You can design your own UI for this, make it simple.
